# In this scenario, we create two profile servers, but start only the first one and then we create 
# a huge number of identities on the first server and then start the second server 
# and let the profiles propagate to the second server.

# Create two profile servers A001 and A002 within 50 km radius of GPS location [10.0, 20.0].
