# In this scenario, we create a group of 3 proximity servers and 10 activities,
# then we create another group of 3 proximity servers and we weakly interconnect these groups.
# Then we create 40 new activities, make some test queries, then delete some activities 
# and then make test queries again.
#
# Finally, we take snapshot.
