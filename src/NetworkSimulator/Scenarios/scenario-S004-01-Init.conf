# In this scenario, we create a large group of profile servers and also large number of identities. 
# Then we save the scenario to a snapshot.

# Make all servers mutual neighbors.
# Note that the neighborhood is established after the server's and identities initialization 
# because otherwise the server's would share a large amount of information with each new server 
# and client created and this would slow down the whole process dramatically.
# The neighborhood relations are also created slowly and in several stages to prevent initialization problems.
