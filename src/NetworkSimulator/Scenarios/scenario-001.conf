# In this scenario, we create two profile servers and make the second server neighbor of the first one.
# Then we create a test identity on the second server and let it propagate to the first server.
#


# Create two profile servers A001 and A002 within 50 km radius of GPS location [10.0, 20.0].
ProfileServer A 2 10000 10.0 20.0 50000

# Make A002 a neighbor of A001.
Neighbor A001 A002

# Start both servers.

# Wait 30 seconds to allow the servers contact each other.

# Create 1 identity on server A002.
