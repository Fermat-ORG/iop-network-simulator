# In this scenario, we create 2 proximity servers within larger area. 
# We make all of them neighbors and then we create larger number of of activities among them 
# and then we perform a number of different test queries.
#
# We are also using several different identities to create these activites 
# hosted on couple of profile servers
#


# Create 1 profile servers PS001.
ProfileServer PS 1 10000 10.0 20.0 500000

# Create 2 proximity servers PXa001 and PXb002.
