# In this scenario, we create 10 proximity servers within larger area. 
# We make all of them neighbors and then we create larger number of of activities among them 
# and then we perform a number of different test queries.
#
# We are also using several different identities to create these activites 
# hosted on couple of profile servers
#
# At the end we take snapshot.
