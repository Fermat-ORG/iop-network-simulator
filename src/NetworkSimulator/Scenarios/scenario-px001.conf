# In this scenario, we create 10 activities on two neighbor proximity servers.
# For that we need an identity and a profile server as well.
#
# We let the activities to be propagated among proximity servers and then we test the propagation went well.

# Create profile server PS001.
ProfileServer PS 1 10000 10.0 20.0 50000

# Create proximity servers PX001 and PX002.

# Make all servers mutual neighbors.
